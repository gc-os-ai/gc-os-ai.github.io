#### Introduction

Welcome to GC.OS!

Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting it.

This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you visit our website.

<br>

#### No Data Collection

We respect your privacy and do not collect any personal data or information from users on this website.

We do not use cookies, analytics, tracking scripts, or any other tools that could gather or process information about your browsing behavior or identity.

<br>

#### Third-Party Links

Our website may contain links to external websites.

Please note that we have no control over the content or privacy practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any external sites you visit.

<br>

#### External Forms

Our website may contain links to external forms that allow you to submit information, managed by us but hosted on third-party platforms, such as Google Forms.

When you submit information via these forms, please be aware that:

Data Collection: The data collected through these forms is directly managed by us for the purposes outlined in each form, as outlined in each form

Third-Party Processing: The hosting platform (e.g., Google) may process certain technical data, such as your IP address, in accordance with its own privacy policies.

Please review the privacy policy of the platform hosting the form before submitting any information, as we do not control their data processing practices.

<br>

#### Data Security

While we do not collect or store any personal data, we have implemented basic security measures to protect the integrity of our website.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet is entirely secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the website.

<br>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

Any changes will be posted on this page with the Last Updated date at the top.
